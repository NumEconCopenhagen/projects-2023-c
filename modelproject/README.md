# Model analysis project

My project is titled **The Solow model with human capital** and is about solving the model, and evaluating what happens when making, ceteris paribus, changes to the saving rates.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
